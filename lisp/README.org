* Directory Organization

  File names are named with the following convention:
  * 0000-0009: Reserved
  * 0010-0029: Emacs built-in package settings.
  * 0030-0049: Built-in Programming modes
  * 0050-0069: Other built-in modes
  * 0070-0099: Reserved
  * 0100-1000: Package configurations
  * 1000-9999: User customs.

  Note that files in the directory are loaded from lowest numerical
  starting value to highest. This means that something with 9999 will
  load after 0001, meaning it has precedence. Doing things this way
  also allows me to manually take care of any dependencies
  (hopefully).
